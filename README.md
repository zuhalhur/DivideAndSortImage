# DivideAndSortImage

# Divide the given image into 10x10 blocks of pixels.
# Calculate the average density of each sub image. You will use the following formula for the intensity calculation: I = 0.298R + 0.587G + 0.114B.  
# Sort the blocks in increasing density value.   
# Place the sorted blocks back into the image (sorted from top to bottom, left to right).
